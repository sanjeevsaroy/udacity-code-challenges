        <p>
          When i was a small boy i saw around me only misery and sadness. For that reason i was always dreaming about bringing happiness and love to this world. Thinking about how i could improve this world <br>
          i came across with qoute:<br>
          <strong>"The end of the world will be, when people stop singing."</strong><br>
          So i decided to create music web dizgo.4fan.cz.<br>
          At the beggining people were talking that i can't do it, but i didn't give up! At times i was constraint to earn money with prostitution, only for dizgo. This web has been developed for years by our developing team into this perfect form. And now we are at the and of our way. <strong>Enjoy it my friends...</strong>
